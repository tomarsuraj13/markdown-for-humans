# Task: Draggable Blocks

## 1. Task Metadata

- **Task name:** Draggable Blocks
- **Slug:** draggable-blocks
- **Status:** in-progress
- **Created:** 2025-11-29
- **Last updated:** 2026-04-15
- **Shipped:** _(pending)_

## 2. Context & Problem

**Current state:**
- Content blocks cannot be reordered visually
- Must cut/paste or type to reorder sections
- No visual feedback for block boundaries
- No intuitive way to restructure documents

**Pain points:**
- **Slow reorganization:** Moving sections requires cut/paste, selection is tedious
- **Error-prone:** Easy to paste in wrong location, lose content
- **No visual structure:** Can't see block boundaries until selected
- **Cognitive overhead:** Mental mapping of "cut this, scroll, find spot, paste"
- **Feature gap:** Draggable blocks with handles improve content organization
- **Professional expectation:** Notion, Coda, ClickUp all have drag-to-reorder

**Why it matters:**
- **Better UX:** Drag-and-drop is more intuitive than cut-paste
- **Faster editing:** Reorganizing documents 5x faster with drag
- **Visual feedback:** Handles show block structure at a glance
- **Professional polish:** Expected feature in modern editors
- **Differentiation:** This feature would be available free and open source

## 3. Desired Outcome & Scope

**Success criteria:**
- Paragraph blocks, headers, lists, tables, code blocks, images all draggable
- Six-dot drag handle appears on hover (left gutter)
- Drag block → visual indicator shows drop target
- Drop block → reorders content, preserves formatting
- Undo/redo support for block moves
- Works smoothly with 500+ block documents
- Keyboard alternative: `Alt+Up/Down` to move blocks

**In scope:**
- **Drag handle:**
  - Six-dot icon (⋮⋮) in left gutter
  - Appears on hover over any block
  - Positioned vertically centered with block
  - Cursor changes to grab/grabbing
- **Draggable block types:**
  - Paragraphs
  - Headers (H1-H6)
  - Lists (bullet, numbered, task)
  - Tables
  - Code blocks
  - Blockquotes
  - Images
  - Horizontal rules
  - Mermaid diagrams
  - Math blocks
- **Drop indicator:**
  - Blue horizontal line showing drop location
  - Appears between blocks as user drags
  - Updates in real-time as drag moves
- **Block highlighting:**
  - Dragged block shows subtle background
  - Drop target highlights on hover
- **Keyboard shortcuts:**
  - `Alt+Up` - Move block up
  - `Alt+Down` - Move block down
  - Works with cursor in block

**Out of scope:**
- Drag across documents (single document only)
- Drag to create copies (`Alt+Drag`) - future feature
- Nested drag-drop (e.g., drag list item within list) - complex, defer
- Drag handles on inline elements (text, links) - block-level only
- Multi-block selection drag - future feature
- Drag to trash/delete - future feature

## 4. UX & Behavior

**Entry points:**
- **Primary:** Hover block → six-dot handle appears → drag
- **Keyboard:** `Alt+Up/Down` to move block up/down
- **Touch:** Long-press on mobile (future enhancement)

**User flows:**

### Flow 1: Reorder paragraphs
1. User has three paragraphs:
   ```
   Paragraph A
   Paragraph B
   Paragraph C
   ```
2. User hovers over "Paragraph B"
3. Six-dot handle (⋮⋮) appears in left gutter
4. User clicks and drags handle down
5. Blue drop line appears between B and C
6. User releases mouse
7. Order becomes:
   ```
   Paragraph A
   Paragraph C
   Paragraph B
   ```

### Flow 2: Move header with nested content
1. Document structure:
   ```
   ## Introduction
   This is intro text.

   ## Features
   Here are features:
   - Feature 1
   - Feature 2

   ## Conclusion
   ```
2. User drags "Features" header handle up
3. Entire "Features" section (header + content + list) moves as one block
4. New order:
   ```
   ## Features
   Here are features:
   - Feature 1
   - Feature 2

   ## Introduction
   This is intro text.

   ## Conclusion
   ```

### Flow 3: Visual feedback during drag
1. User starts dragging paragraph
2. Visual changes:
   - Dragged block: Slight opacity (0.7), shows it's "lifted"
   - Cursor: Changes to grabbing hand
   - Drop indicator: Blue line (3px) appears between blocks
3. As user moves mouse up/down:
   - Drop line moves to show target location
   - Smooth animation following mouse
4. User releases → block snaps into place with subtle animation

### Flow 4: Keyboard block movement
1. User positions cursor in paragraph they want to move
2. User presses `Alt+Down`
3. Paragraph swaps with paragraph below (smooth animation)
4. Cursor stays in moved paragraph
5. User presses `Alt+Down` again → moves down another position
6. User presses `Ctrl+Z` → undoes moves

### Flow 5: Moving table
1. User has large table (10 rows)
2. User hovers over table
3. Drag handle appears at top-left of table
4. User drags table down past three paragraphs
5. Table moves as single unit (all rows together)
6. Drops into new position

### Flow 6: Invalid drop prevention
1. User drags header
2. Tries to drop header inside code block
3. Drop indicator turns red (invalid)
4. Releasing mouse cancels drag, block returns to original position
5. Message: "Cannot drop header inside code block"

### Flow 7: Long-distance drag
1. User wants to move block from top to bottom of 100-line doc
2. User starts dragging block
3. Document auto-scrolls as user drags near top/bottom edge
4. Scroll speed increases if user holds near edge
5. User finds target location, releases
6. Block moves, scroll returns to dropped location

**Behavior rules:**
- **Drag initiation:** Click and hold handle 200ms, or drag immediately
- **Block grouping:** Headers drag with all content until next same-level header
- **Auto-scroll:** Document scrolls when dragging near edges (threshold: 50px from edge)
- **Drop validation:**
  - Can't drop inside code blocks
  - Can't drop inside inline elements
  - Can't drop nested headers incorrectly (maintain hierarchy)
- **Visual feedback:**
  - Dragged block: 70% opacity, slight shadow
  - Drop line: 3px blue horizontal line
  - Invalid drop: Red drop line
- **Undo/redo:** Block move is single undoable operation
- **Performance:** Smooth 60fps dragging even with 500+ blocks
- **Cursor preservation:** Cursor stays in moved block after drop
- **Keyboard moves:** `Alt+Up/Down` moves one position at a time, repeatable

**Visual design:**
- **Drag handle (⋮⋮):**
  - Size: 20x20px
  - Color: Muted gray (matches editor colors at 40% opacity)
  - Hover: Brightens to 70% opacity
  - Active (dragging): 100% opacity, slight background circle
  - Position: Left gutter, 8px from content
  - Vertical align: Centered with first line of block

- **Drop indicator:**
  - Color: Blue (`#0969da` or theme accent)
  - Height: 3px
  - Width: Full editor width
  - Style: Solid line
  - Invalid: Red (`#cf222e`)
  - Animation: Slide to new position (100ms ease)

## 4b. Current Functionality (source of truth)

- **User-facing:** No draggable blocks or handles today. Reordering requires cut/paste. No keyboard move for block-level reordering.
- **Technical:** TipTap editor in `src/webview/editor.ts` with StarterKit, lists, tables, task lists, code blocks, Mermaid, images. No drag/drop extension for block moves. `imageDragDrop` exists but only for images. No block move commands. Undo/redo is standard ProseMirror history. No VS Code APIs required beyond the webview.
- **Pattern to follow:** Implement as a TipTap/ProseMirror plugin/extension with decorations (for handles/indicators) and transactions for block moves; follow modern editor UX patterns; keep logic webview-only (TextDocument stays source of truth).

---

## 5. Technical Plan

- **Surfaces:** Webview only (TipTap extension + decorations + DOM overlay). No extension-side changes required beyond defaults.
- **Key changes:**
  - `src/webview/extensions/draggableBlocks.ts` (new): TipTap extension with plugin that:
    - Identifies draggable block boundaries (paragraphs, headings, lists, tables, blockquotes, code blocks, mermaid/math blocks, images, HR).
    - Adds handle decorations (six-dot) on hover/active.
    - Adds drop indicator decoration/overlay with valid/invalid states.
    - Handles drag start/move/end; computes target position and runs a ProseMirror transaction to move the block (preserving selection, single undo step).
    - Keyboard move commands (`Alt+Up/Down`) to move current block.
    - Auto-scroll when dragging near viewport edges.
    - Invalid drop detection (e.g., not inside code blocks).
  - `src/webview/editor.ts`: Register extension; wire keyboard shortcuts; ensure outline/toolbar remain unaffected.
  - `src/webview/editor.css`: Handle/indicator styling (theme-aware, hover/active states, drop line colors).
- **Architecture notes:** Keep all logic in webview; no TextDocument writes beyond the normal edit message flow. Use ProseMirror transactions for moves to preserve history. Use decorations, not DOM mutation. Avoid blocking TipTap update loop; debounce expensive computations if needed on large docs.
- **Performance considerations:** Efficient block scanning (single pass); minimal re-render during drag; throttle auto-scroll; avoid heavy DOM reads in mousemove; ensure 60fps target on large docs.

## 6. Work Breakdown

| ✅ done | Implement draggableBlocks extension | New `src/webview/extensions/draggableBlocks.ts`; block boundary detection; DOM overlay handle/drop indicator; drag move logic. |
| ✅ done | Keyboard move commands | `Alt+Up/Down` moves current block via command; single undoable step; cursor stays in block. |
| ✅ done | Auto-scroll + drop validation | Scroll when near edges; prevent invalid drops (e.g., inside code blocks); show red indicator on invalid. |
| ✅ done | Integrate + shortcuts | Registered extension in `editor.ts`; keyboard shortcuts via `addKeyboardShortcuts()`. |
| ✅ done | Styling | CSS for handle/drop-indicator (theme-aware, hover/active, invalid state, reduced-motion). |
| ✅ done | Tests (webview) | Unit tests: block detection, move up/down, boundary conditions, extension registration. |
| pending | Manual verification | Scenarios: drag paragraphs/headers/lists/tables/code/images; auto-scroll long doc; invalid drop shows red and cancels; undo/redo works; handles visible on hover; drop indicator follows cursor. |
| pending | Ship | Update task status, move to `roadmap/shipped/` when done. |

## 7. Implementation Log

### 2025-12-01 – Discovery/Refine update

- Clarified that no draggable support exists; all work will be webview TipTap extension with decorations and transactions.
- Added plan for handles, drop indicators, keyboard moves, auto-scroll, invalid drop states, and tests.

- **Dragged block:**
  - Opacity: 0.7
  - Shadow: `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)`
  - Background: Slightly darker than editor
  - Border: 1px dashed gray
  - Cursor: `grabbing`

- **Gutter:**
  - Width: 32px (space for handle)
  - Only visible on hover (clean by default)
  - Handles appear smoothly (fade in 100ms)

**Edge cases:**
- **Empty blocks:** Paragraph with only `\n` still draggable (moves cursor position)
- **First/last block:** Can drag to any position, including first/last
- **Nested lists:** Dragging list item moves entire nested tree
- **Mixed content:** Dragging header moves content until next header of same level
- **Incomplete drag:** Releasing outside editor cancels drag
- **Rapid drags:** Debounce move operations to avoid state confusion
- **Very large blocks:** Tables with 100+ rows still drag smoothly
- **Concurrent edits:** If document changes during drag, cancel drag
- **Touch devices:** Handle appears on long-press (future mobile support)

## 7. Implementation Log

### 2026-04-15 — Implementation

- Created `src/webview/extensions/draggableBlocks.ts` (TipTap Extension).
- **Architecture choice:** DOM overlay (not ProseMirror decorations) for the handle and drop indicator — avoids decoration churn on every `mousemove`, stays within 16ms typing budget.
- `DragHandleController` class manages the six-dot handle element and drop-indicator line:
  - Attached to `view.dom.parentElement` (scrolls with content, positioned absolutely).
  - `mousemove` over the editor: resolves the top-level block at cursor, positions handle vertically centred.
  - Handle is `draggable=true`; on `dragstart` stores `draggedPos`, sets blank ghost image, dims the dragged block.
  - `dragover` recomputes best-fit insert position, snaps indicator to block boundaries, validates drop target.
  - Auto-scroll using `requestAnimationFrame` when cursor is within 60px of viewport edge (up to 16px/frame).
  - Invalid drops (inside `codeBlock` or `mathBlock`) turn the indicator red and abort the move on `drop`.
  - `moveBlockUp` / `moveBlockDown` commands swap current top-level block with its sibling via a single ProseMirror transaction (single undo step).
- Registered `DraggableBlocks` in `src/webview/editor.ts` extensions list.
- Added keyboard shortcuts: `Alt+↑` / `Alt+↓` via `addKeyboardShortcuts()`.
- Added CSS in `src/webview/editor.css`: handle styling (grab cursor, six-dot SVG, fade-in animation), drop indicator (blue/red 3px line with knob), dragged block dimming, `prefers-reduced-motion` safe.
- Added `overflow-x: visible` to `.markdown-editor` so handles in the 28px left gutter are never clipped.
- Tests: 5 passing in `src/__tests__/webview/draggableBlocks.test.ts`; full suite 659 pass / 0 fail.

## 9. Follow-up & Future Work

- Multi-block selection drag (select + drag multiple blocks)
- Drag to duplicate (Alt+Drag creates copy)
- Drag across documents (split editors)
- Drag to sidebar/outline for quick reorganization
- Drag handles for inline elements (links, images within paragraphs)
- Touch device optimization (mobile drag-drop)
- Drag to trash/delete (drag to editor edge)
- Smart suggestions (e.g., "Move all H2s under this H1?")
- History visualization (show block movements in diff)
- Export handling (preserve order in exports)
