*Experience seamless WYSIWYG markdown editing with visual table editing, image management, and more—all in VS Code.*

## Stop Fighting Markdown Syntax

**Tired of manually writing table syntax? Struggling with image paths, resizing, renaming? Or you dont like memorising Markdown Syntax.** 

Most markdown editors force you to memorize syntax, fight with split panes, or manually manage files. **Markdown for Humans solves the biggest pain points** that make markdown editing frustrating.

> **📌 100% free. No trials. No limits. No paywalls, ever.**

## Visual Table Editing (No More Syntax)

As natural as it gets in Microsoft Word or Google Docs etc. 

![Table Editing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concretios/markdown-for-humans/integration/marketplace-assets/gifs/table_operations_with_right_click_menu.gif)

**Drag column borders to resize. Right-click to add rows. No syntax to memorize.**

- ✅ **Drag-to-resize columns** — Click and drag column borders, just like Excel
- ✅ **Right-click context menu** — Insert/delete rows and columns instantly
- ✅ **Toolbar controls** — Add/remove rows and columns with dropdown menus
- ✅ **Tab navigation** — Move between cells with Tab/Shift+Tab

*Stop counting pipes and dashes. Start editing tables visually.*

---

## Image Management That Actually Works

> Press shift while dragging images, in case your face issues on drag drop in editor

![Large Size Image Suggestion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concretios/markdown-for-humans/integration/marketplace-assets/gifs/large_size_image_size_suggestion.gif)

**Drag images in. Resize with handles. Rename inline. No manual file operations.**

- ✅ **Drag & drop** — Drop images directly into your document
- ✅ **In-place resizing** — Drag handles to adjust width, see live preview
- ✅ **Auto-size suggestions** — Get warnings for oversized images (saves your storage on GIT)
- ✅ **Rename images** — Change filenames without leaving the editor (we rename file on disk, and also update the markdown code)
- ✅ **Metadata overlay** — View dimensions, file size, and path at a glance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We backup original image always, before resizing.

*Adjust image width with intuitive resize handles for perfect layout control.*

![Image Rename Functionality](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concretios/markdown-for-humans/integration/marketplace-assets/gifs/image_rename_functionality.gif)

*Rename images directly from the editor to keep your assets organized.*

## Built on True WYSIWYG Editing
Humans work that way.

![WYSIWYG Editing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concretios/markdown-for-humans/integration/marketplace-assets/gifs/basic_introduction.gif)

**See your formatted output as you type. No split panes. No preview mode. Just write.**

Built on TipTap with a **human-first design philosophy**:

- **Persistent formatting bar** — See your options, click what you need
- **Floating shortcuts** — Actions appear where you need them (Tables: right-click, Images: More icon)
- **No command palette overload** — Actions are visible, not buried in `/commands`
- **No context switching** — Everything you need is right there

## Why We Built This

**Writing should feel natural, not technical.** You shouldn't need to memorize syntax, dig through command palettes, or fight with your tools. You should just write.

Existing markdown editors force writers to choose between split-pane previews that waste screen space, plain text editing that requires memorizing syntax, standalone apps that don't integrate with your workflow, or command-heavy interfaces that bury actions in overloaded palettes.

We built Markdown for Humans to solve the **real pain points**—tables and images—that make markdown editing frustrating, while keeping the underlying file as plain markdown (so Git diffs, tooling, and other editors still work).

## Vibe Coded its way

This extension was built through AI / **vibe coding**, with minimal human effort focused on fixes and stability. The basic functional model came together in minutes, but what took days and hours was **testing each feature** to ensure everything works smoothly in real-world use. 

It's the classic 80:20 rule in action: that final 20% of polish, edge cases, and real-world testing takes 80% of the time, and that's where the real value lives.

We're open-sourcing this because in AI era, **code has limited value**, the real work was in the creativity in planning, design, and relentless testing. 

Countless hours went into vibe-coded wireframes, user experience design, and polish to create something that feels natural and intuitive.
